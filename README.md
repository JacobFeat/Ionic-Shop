I am currently developing a mobile application using Ionic with Angular. The application is a store app, which will be available on iOS, Android, and web browsers. I am drawing inspiration from the layout and design of the H&M application for my project. I aim to incorporate some of their features while also introducing unique and innovative functionalities to provide an enhanced shopping experience to the users. The app's features are currently being implemented. To run the application, please click on the provided link and open the dev tools to select the mobile view.
